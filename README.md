.:.:.: SO WHAT THE HECK IS THIS, ANYWAY? :.:.:.

GitHub is a website for collaborating on projects.  At it's heart, its a version control application - a useful tool that makes it easy for multiple people to edit the same bunches of files at the same time without stomping all over eachother's changes.  Basically, people can work on their own versions of the files, and then merge them together whenever they want to.  GitHub automatically takes each person's changes and either applies them or highlights places where conflicting changes need to be worked out.

A lot of people think GitHub is only for code, but that's not quite true.  While that is probably its most common usage, and one of its most powerful, in reality GitHub can store any sort of file you want.  Think of it as a group Dropbox on steroids.

If you're new to Git, read the instructions section.  If not, message me and I'll add you as a contributor for teh HAXXORZ!

.:.:.: INSTRUCTIONS :.:.:.
 
 If you're new to GitHub, fear not.  It may seem a little tricky at first but it'll very quickly become one of your best friends for group project management.
 
(1) First step is to create an account.  Message me (Alex) and I can add you as a contributor to the project.  It's public, so I may not even need to, but it certainly won't hurt.

(2) Are you a super-cool Linux hipster?  If not, download the GitHub client app for whichever operating system you happen to be on.  Either mac.github.com or windows.github.com.  Enter your username and password and stuff, and you're all set up.

(3) Here's where the magic starts to happen.  If I've added you as a contributor to our project, you should be able to see this repo (a repository, or "repo", is just a storage space for files) in the desktop app.  Go to the section in the left panel that has your username and it should show up.

(4) Click 'clone to computer' or whatever sounds closest to that.  What this does is copy the repository over to a folder on your computer.  We'll see why this is useful in a moment.

(5) Make changes to files.  Better yet, add a file of your own (whatever you want).  Create a file, and save it in the repository folder (the one that you just created/cloned to your computer).

(6) Back in the GitHub desktop app, double click on this repository.  On the left, you should see a button saying 'Changes' with a + and - sign.  Click on it.

(7) Once there, you should see a section that says 'Uncommitted Changes'.  It should prompt you for a summary.  Basically all its asking is for you to tell it what exactly you did.  When you push your changes up to the central repo, it'll help all of us to see a description of what you did.

(8) Press 'Commit', and then 'Sync' (or something like that) down a little lower.  If you go to the History area (look for the button in the left panel) you should be able to see your changes along with the description you entered.

(9) If you ever want to sync your computer's folder with all the changes people have made, just press 'Sync Branch' in the top right.  That'll change the folder on your computer according to the latest version of what everyone has done.

(10) There's some more advanced functions like branching, forking, etc, but we don't need to worry about those for now.

Good Luck!  Message me if you have any problems.
